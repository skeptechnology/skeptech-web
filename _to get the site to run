# If you get errors, then you need to update angular.json to change the output folder to just "dist", 
#                   then you need to update package.json & replace the dexam text with skeptech.

# NOTE 1: Make sure there is a CNAME file is present AND that is only has the URL/domain for the site "skeptech.com"

# NOTE 2: Within the repo, go to settings and make sure the following are set:
# Source = gh-pages branch
# Custom domain = skeptech.com
